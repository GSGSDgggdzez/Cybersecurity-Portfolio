# Cybersecurity-Portfolio

This repository documents my journey to becoming a professional red team operator. It serves as a living portfolio of my hands-on work, containing detailed write-ups of home lab projects, Capture The Flag solutions, and security research. The focus is on emulating real-world adversary TTPs in enterprise environments and practicing the art of clear, professional documentation.
